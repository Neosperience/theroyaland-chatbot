The RoyaLand Company Ltd is a holding company focused on creating an online and offline immersive, fantasy-based royalty-themed experience, powered by artificial intelligence, primarily centered around a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, or MMORPG, called The RoyaLand. We are developing the experiences in collaboration with our founder, the Monaco-based grandson of the last King of Italy, Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia. In addition, with the support of and affiliation with 7 other Royal Families and families with legal, hereditary, or historically based claims to royal positions in Russia, Albania, France, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Lesotho, and Mecklenburg collectively referred to as the Royal Families, The RoyaLand is intended to deliver this unique past-meets-future entertainment experience. 

Royal Dynasties and Families involved in The RoyaLand: Royal House of Italy, Imperial House of Romanoff, Royal House of Albania, Royal House of France, Royal House of Bulgaria, Royal House of Yugoslavia, The Royal House of Lesotho, The House of Mecklenburg.

The RoyaLand: An overview of the game world. In our collective imagination, the future is often painted in bleak, dystopian hues, dominated by invasive technologies and polluted landscapes. Yet, there’s a school of thought and an artistic movement that challenges this narrative: the solarpunk style. Picture a world where technology harmoniously melds with nature, where cities are draped in green and powered by renewable energies, and where society is built on principles of equity and sustainability. This is the beating heart of solarpunk, an optimistic and revolutionary vision of the future. We decided to bring this optimistic vision of the future, enriched with characteristics of the fantasy world, into the world of The RoyaLand. 

The technological landscape of The RoyaLand is dominated by the omnipresent network, which is widely accessible. This networked world is further enhanced by the Agents, highly evolved artificial intelligence systems. These Agents are adept at performing a myriad of tasks, making life in The RoyaLand efficient and streamlined. The Political Landscape: Realms and Rulers. Politically, The RoyaLand is a mosaic of Realms, each under the stewardship of a Royal Family. These realms are not just monolithic entities but have a layered hierarchy comprising of Counts, Dukes, Marquises, and other nobility. These nobles don’t just enjoy titular prominence; they play pivotal roles in the governance of their respective realms, overseeing territories, domains, and valuable assets. Earning a noble title in The RoyaLand isn’t merely a birthright. It’s a blend of meritocracy and strategic appointments by the ruling families. However, with power comes responsibility and the risk of losing it. The game’s political dynamics ensure that rulers can be dethroned, either through a consensus of the nobility or through popular uprisings.

The game introduces eight dominant Royal Houses (Royal House of Italy, Imperial House of Romanoff, Royal House of Albania, Royal House of France, Royal House of Bulgaria, Royal House of Yugoslavia, The Royal House of Lesotho, The House of Mecklenburg.), each ruling over their respective Great Realms. The fate of the remaining realms is intriguing. The RoyaLand is not just a game; it’s a journey into a world where technology, politics, and nature coalesce to create a captivating narrative. Whether you’re a strategist, a tech enthusiast, or someone who enjoys intricate world-building, The RoyaLand promises an immersive experience. Continue to follow the development of the game to discover what makes The RoyaLand unique in the gaming landscape.

A new way to play and interact with the community. The landscape of gaming has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, largely due to the advent of high-quality, engaging games. These games have not only changed the way we play but also the way we interact with others, fostering a sense of community among players worldwide.

Dario Melpignano is a technology consultant for The RoyaLand project, providing Neosperience’s artificial intelligence. Since 2007 Mr Melpignano is CEO and co-founder of Neosperience. He created the Neosperience Cloud application platform – starting from the development of the first apps with the launch of the iPhone 3G in Europe – for the creation of omnichannel services that innovate the Digital Experience. Neosperience won the Red Herring Top 100 award first at European level and then worldwide, obtaining intemational recognition of Gartner Cool Vendor and winning QUID Innovation Italy awards and Gran Prix Publicity Italia. In 2016 he co-founded Neosurance, a Neosperience insurtech spinoff, which in less than a year became a leading disruptor of the insurance world in Europe, obtaining a number of awards. In 2017 he co-founded Bikevo, a sportech start-up dedicated to the training of amateur cyclists, and WizKey dedicated to the legaltech for the purchase and sale of credits integrated with blockchain. In 2018, he embarked on an ambitious development path in the fusion of empathy in technology through artificial intelligence. Neosperience was referenced by Gartner as one of the new pioneers of AI and indicated as the only European reference company, alongside Adobe, IBM and Microsoft. On February 20, 2019, he debuted in Piazza Affari listing Neosperience in an IPO that recorded an increase of +38.6% on the first day. During 2020, he accelerated the development of the Company with a series of acquisitions of software vendors, homogeneous in values and complementary in the offer, giving life to the national pole of digital solutions development. With the defeatcovid.org project, he gave the global community the first machine learning model to help diagnose Covid-19, subsequently treasuring the experience with the launch of a Company business unit dedicated to healthtech.

The Company is currently in the development phase and has entered into a project agreement with Neosperience S.p.A. who will design and develop The RoyaLand using AI-enabled technology. Neosperience plans to use AI models to create complex and dynamic in-game environments and realistic and emotive characters and to assist with dynamically adjusting the difficulty level and game balance in real-time based on player behavior and performance to keep the game challenging yet rewarding. For example, Neosperience’s AI-enabled technology can imbue non-player characters, or NPCs, with various behaviors, which we believe makes them seem more lifelike and responsive thereby enhancing player immersion and creating a more engaging gameplay experience. Additionally, Neosperience intends to use advanced modeling and rendering techniques to create realistic player characters and NPCs that dynamically interact utilizing a full range of human-like emotions, reactions, and movements (“digital humans”) giving them a depth of character which we believe is rarely seen in video games. 

The Company’s objective is to capitalize on the expanding video games market -- with worldwide revenue expected to grow to approximately $366B in 2023 according to Statista -- by connecting and engaging with players from around the world through epic royalty-themed entertainment and becoming a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and services as well as related media delivering engaging entertainment experiences to its network of connected players on a year-round basis.

Their rule extended to the Kingdom of Sicily in the early 18th century, and they later gained control over Sardinia. In the 19th century, the House of Savoy played a pivotal role in the Italian unification movement, leading to the establishment of the Kingdom of Italy. Prominent Savoyard kings of Italy included Victor Emmanuel II, Umberto I, Victor Emmanuel III, and Umberto II.

Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, and Ahmet Zogu played a crucial role in the country's political landscape during this period. He was elected as Albania's Prime Minister in 1922. In 1928, Ahmet Zogu declared himself King Zog I of Albania, effectively establishing a monarchy in the country.

The House of Zogu's history is intertwined with Albania's journey toward independence and modernization in the early 20th century, leaving a lasting impact on the country's political and cultural history.

Leka Anwar Zog Reza Baudouin Msiziwe Zogu, Prince of Albania, was born on March 26, 1982, in Tirana, Albania. He was the only son of Leka, Prince of Albania, and his wife, Susan Cullen-Ward. Leka was born into the Albanian royal family during a time when the monarchy had been abolished, and Albania was a republic. Leka grew up in exile, primarily in South Africa and the United Kingdom, as his family continued their efforts to maintain their royal status and engage with Albanian exiles and supporters. In 2002, a significant event occurred in Leka's life and the history of the Albanian monarchy. A referendum was held in Albania to determine whether the country should restore the monarchy. Although the referendum did not result in a return to monarchy, it allowed Leka and his family to make a high-profile return to Albania, where they were met with both enthusiasm and controversy. Leka Anwar Zog Reza Baudouin Msiziwe Zogu, often referred to simply as Leka II, continued to be involved in Albanian public life and maintained connections with various political and social figures in the country. He inherited the role of head of the House of Zogu from his father, Leka, Prince of Albania, and carried on the family's commitment to the idea of a constitutional monarchy.

He married Elia Zaharia, and the couple had a son named Leka, born in 2011.

The history of the Bulgarian royal family is marked by periods of monarchy and republicanism. It has its origins in the medieval Bulgarian Empire, which spanned from the 7th to the 14th century, and was ruled by notable monarchs such as Khan Asparuh, Khan Krum, and Tsar Simeon I. However, in 1396, Bulgaria fell under Ottoman Turkish rule, enduring nearly five centuries of foreign domination. During this extended period, Bulgaria lost its sovereignty, and its monarchy ceased to exist. It wasn't until 1908 that Bulgaria regained its independence and established a constitutional monarchy, with Ferdinand I as its first monarch. This marked a new era for the Bulgarian monarchy. After World War II, Bulgaria was declared a people's republic, and the monarchy was abolished in 1946. The royal family went into exile, and Bulgaria remained a communist state until the early 1990s. With the fall of communism, Bulgaria transitioned to a democratic republic. Some members of the former royal family, including Simeon II, returned to Bulgaria and became involved in politics. Simeon II even served as the country's Prime Minister from 2001 to 2005. While Bulgaria remains a republic, the history of its royal family reflects the nation's complex journey through monarchy, foreign rule, and republicanism.

The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is a European royal dynasty with its origins in the 19th century. It was formed when Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, married Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg in 1826, merging the two German duchies. Their descendants adopted the name Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. One of the most notable members of this dynasty was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who married Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in 1840. This marriage had a significant impact on European royal history, as their descendants became connected to numerous European royal families. King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, the son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, initiated the use of the family name Windsor during World War I due to anti-German sentiments. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha also produced Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, who became the first monarch of independent Bulgaria in 1908. In 1917, during World War I, King George V of the United Kingdom officially changed the house's name to the House of Windsor to distance the British monarchy from its Germanic associations. Despite this change, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha continues to play a role in the history and genealogy of European royalty.

The Karađorđević dynasty is a Serbian royal dynasty with a history dating back to the early 19th century. It was founded by Karađorđe Petrović, a Serbian revolutionary leader who played a crucial role in the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire. Under Karađorđe's leadership, the Serbs sought to gain autonomy and independence from Ottoman rule. The First Serbian Uprising began in 1804 and marked the beginning of the dynasty's prominence. Karađorđe Petrović was elected as the leader of the Serbian rebels, and they managed to establish a semi-autonomous Serbian state. However, the uprising was ultimately crushed by the Ottomans in 1813, leading to Karađorđe's exile. In 1815, Miloš Obrenović, a rival leader, assumed power in Serbia, and the Obrenović dynasty came to prominence. The Karađorđevićs remained in exile for several decades. The fortunes of the Karađorđević dynasty changed in the mid-19th century when Karađorđe's descendants returned to Serbia. In 1903, King Alexander I of Serbia, a member of the Karađorđević family, led a successful coup against the Obrenović monarchy. This event marked the restoration of the Karađorđević dynasty to the Serbian throne. Today, the Karađorđević dynasty maintains a presence in Serbia, and Crown Prince Alexander has worked on various philanthropic and cultural initiatives. While Serbia remains a republic, the Karađorđevićs continue to hold a symbolic and historical significance in the country's history.

His presence represents a link to Serbia's royal history and traditions, even in the modern era.

Moshoeshoe I, born around 1786 and passing away on March 11, 1870, was a pivotal historical figure as the first king of Lesotho. He hailed from the Bamokoteli lineage, a sub-clan of the Basotho people, and was the son of Mokhachane and Kholu. His original name was Lepoqo, which meant "Dispute," a name attributed to accusations of witchcraft around the time of his birth. In his youth, Moshoeshoe helped his father consolidate power over smaller clans, and at the age of 34, he established his own clan and became a chief. His followers settled at the Butha-Buthe Mountain. In 1822, Moshoeshoe became the first and longest-reigning King of Lesotho.. During the 1820s, the Basotho faced cattle raids by the Koranna, leading to their first encounters with horses and guns. Moshoeshoe and his people acquired horses and guns, amassing more than any other chieftain in South Africa by 1843. In 1843, Moshoeshoe signed a treaty with the British Cape Colony, recognizing the Basotho as allies. Over the years, he navigated negotiations and treaties while dealing with colonial pressures and territorial disputes. Moshoeshoe's legacy includes his role in establishing the nation of the Basotho, and he is celebrated annually on Moshoeshoe Day, a national holiday in Lesotho. The Moshoeshoe I International Airport bears his name, and South African shweshwe fabric is named after him, as he popularized it in his realm.

The House of Mecklenburg, a European dynasty, has its origins dating back to the 12th century in what is now known as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, northern Germany. This noble house emerged as a prominent force in the region through strategic marriages and alliances, eventually establishing two main duchies: Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. These duchies, initially part of the Holy Roman Empire, expanded their territories over the centuries. The House of Mecklenburg endured the challenges of the devastating Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, leading to economic hardships and destruction in the region. During this time, Mecklenburg-Schwerin came under Swedish control. However, after the war, it was returned to the House of Mecklenburg. In the 18th century, the dukes of Mecklenburg embraced Enlightenment ideals, leading to a period of reform and modernization in governance, education, and agriculture. This era marked significant progress for the region. The 19th century saw Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz as grand duchies within the newly formed German Empire in 1871. They retained some autonomy within the empire. Today, the House of Mecklenburg exists as a noble family with historical significance but without any ruling authority. Members of the house are involved in various charitable activities and cultural endeavors, contributing to the region's rich heritage. While no longer governing the region, the House of Mecklenburg remains an important part of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's history.

He is part of the broader European aristocracy and has connections to other noble houses across the continent. The House of Mecklenburg has a rich history in northern Germany, where they once ruled as dukes over the region of Mecklenburg. While they no longer hold any political power, the family continues to maintain its traditions and cultural heritage. Duke Michael's life, like many modern nobles, involves a mix of public appearances, cultural engagements, and family responsibilities. He represents a link to the historical legacy of his family and the broader aristocratic tradition in Germany and Europe. While not a prominent figure on the international stage, Duke Michael of Mecklenburg is a reminder of the enduring presence of noble houses in contemporary society, contributing to the preservation of cultural heritage and traditions.

Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia says: The idea for The RoyaLand came about two or three years ago, driven by my royal heritage and inspired by popular Netflix series like The Crown and Downton Abbey. I envisioned a game where players could interact with real royalty, blending fantasy and reality in a groundbreaking way. Other royal families quickly took interest in the idea, recognizing it as a means to connect with the youth and share our values and histories. In The RoyaLand, 'royalty' signifies values, not just lineage. The game challenges players to rise through the ranks, stressing heritage, perseverance, value, and family. It also incorporates artificial intelligence to give characters human-like behaviors for unique interactions and experiences.

Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia says: Regarding the target audience for The RoyaLand, I believe the game will appeal to a diverse group of players. Its elements range from Royale battles to strategy and love, and the use of artificial intelligence adds a layer of depth. Players can partake in a variety of activities, including land conquests and energy strategies. The game's aesthetics mix futuristic visuals with educational themes, particularly sustainability. At launch, the game will feature eight royal families, such as the Italian, Romanoff, Albanian, French, Bulgarian, Yugoslavian, Mecklenburg, and Lesotho families. I look forward to more families joining as the game evolves. The RoyaLand is set to bridge the gap between players and the enigmatic world of royalty, fostering connections and encouraging a sustainable future.

Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing various sectors, particularly with AI-generated voice synthesis that creates human-like audio. In developing a synthetic voice for CEO Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia, we started by collecting a wide array of his spoken-word recordings. The next step involved pre-processing, where we broke down these recordings into short clips and extracted key features like spectrograms and MFCCs. We then evaluated different models, ultimately choosing one that faithfully reproduced Emanuele Filiberto’s voice. A rigorous training process followed, with careful model optimization and constant performance monitoring. After training, we thoroughly evaluated the synthetic voice, seeking feedback to ensure its authenticity. Finally, post-processing adjustments were made to enhance quality. This meticulous process resulted in a realistic synthetic voice that will be used for Emanuele Filiberto's virtual avatar and in-game content.

We've embarked on a project to integrate Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia, The RoyaLand CEO, into the gaming world as a Digital Human, a venture that reflects the increasing prevalence of virtual avatars. The development began with the meticulous collection of Emanuele Filiberto's images and videos, capturing his likeness and expressions to ensure the avatar's realism. In the modeling phase, we used advanced software to create a three-dimensional model, paying close attention to detailed features such as skin texture and facial contours. We then programmed the avatar with AI algorithms to emulate his natural movements and expressions. The avatar, enhanced by recent voice cloning technology, can now speak over 100 languages and display corresponding facial expressions. This breakthrough allows for a globally engaging gaming experience with personalized content. Emanuele Filiberto's Digital Human will also produce video content for our platforms and guide players in The RoyaLand game.

We have started a deeper exploration of the fashion and aesthetics defining this realms in The RoyaLand. We have started to delve into an in-depth style analysis, particularly focusing on the female characters who will breathe life into this world. Realms' fashion is a captivating fusion of historical garments and avant-garde accessories, meticulously designed to emphasize a seamless integration between the attire and the lush natural surroundings of the kingdom. Imagine flowing gowns that echo the elegance and simplicity of fashion, adorned with intricate, nature-inspired patterns and textures that seem to blur the lines between fabric and flora. Our designers are pushing the boundaries of creativity by incorporating elements that symbolize the kingdom’s technological advancements. Accessories are not mere decorations but are symbiotic extensions of the wearer, featuring innovative materials that respond to and harmonize with the environment. These futuristic elements are seamlessly woven into the fabric of traditional attire, creating a striking contrast that is both ethereal and grounded.

We have developed some styles of clothing that describe different types of characters. In particular, we will see how the style of the characters changes according to the social role and the player’s choices when creating the character. The adventurer: This type of character will have mostly military clothing: highly technological armor but, at the same time, enriched by natural elements that can be found in accessories such as cloaks, gloves, jackets, etc. The marginalized: This type of character, characterized by poorer and simpler clothing, will inhabit the suburbs of the cities of the game kingdoms. The clothing is civil and characterized by natural, lightly processed fabrics. The technological element will not fail to appear in accessories such as glasses, gloves, etc. The Knight: This image shows a knight of the kingdom, dressed in the clothes that represent his family, however of humble origin. The knights are characterized by a dress of representation that they hardly give up. Here too, the naturalness of the materials is predominant. The Noble: The nobles of the highest rank will be characterized by military-type clothes, rich, majestic and highly technological. Clothing that instills fear and respect, and offers significant power-ups in battle. 

How The RoyaLand Team created Roy, an AI chatbot that will live in our website and in The RoyaLand: We needed to clearly define what we wanted Roy to do. In this case, Roy had to be able to provide information about the game, its world, and potentially interact with users as if it were a character from the game itself. We selected an appropriate Large Language Model (LLM) that suits our needs. The key is to ensure it can be integrated into our website and has the capability to be fine-tuned for our specific requirements. Since Roy’s knowledge is limited to our game, which is still in development, we gathered all available information about the game. This includes background stories, character details, game mechanics, and lore. We preprocessed this data to format it in a way that’s easily ingestible by the LLM. We used the collected data to fine-tune the LLM. This involved training the model on specific content related to our game to ensure Roy can respond accurately to queries about the game. Since the game involves different Royal Families around the world, We included also detailed information about them in our training data. Since Roy is a character in our game, its responses should reflect its personality and role in the game world. This involves scripting responses or modifying the model’s outputs to be consistent with Roy’s character: a very polite butler! We developed a frontend interface on our website where users can interact with Roy. This interface is user-friendly and visually aligns with the game’s aesthetic. Backend integration involves setting up APIs to communicate with the LLM. 

Roy’s future within The RoyaLand: As our game is still in development, we’ll regularly update Roy’s knowledge base with new information as the game’s content evolves. Also, we’ll maintain the system to ensure its performance remains optimal. We’ll analyze how users are interacting with Roy to understand their needs and preferences better. This feedback can be used to refine Roy’s responses and functionalities. By following these steps, we can ensure Roy effectively serves as an engaging and informative character-based chatbot, enriching the user experience on our game’s website and creating interest in the game before its release. Finally, after the game’s release, Roy and all his siblings will become an integral part of The RoyaLand environment. Each player will have a personal “Roy” who will have the role of assisting and supporting the player during their missions and activities.

What will the weapons be like in The RoyaLand: There will be different types of ranged guns in The RoyaLand: most will work with energy, that is, they’ll shoot energy waves and laser beams to wound, stun and eliminate enemies. The range of action will be very varied, as well as the damage they’ll allow to inflict. In The RoyaLand you’ll be able to also use energy crossbows: heavy weapons, which can deal great damage to many enemies together. Sidearms become very useful in hand-to-hand combat, capable of inflicting great damage on enemies over short distances.

Since Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia was a young boy, video games began to ignite his curiosity. He fondly remembers his first Game Boy, which He still has somewhere in the house. He was already quite grown up when it arrived in Europe, and He remembers His parents weren’t too happy about him spending his evenings at home in that way. But playing Super Mario was a joy. Over the years, his passion has evolved. After a period when He had stopped playing, in the last decade the old passion returned. The first game He played after a long time was The Witcher 3. Another game that stole a lot of his time and energy was Crusader Kings 3: playing as Savoy, being a Savoy himself, was not trivial!
However, a significant turning point in his gaming experience occurred during the lockdown for Covid-19. Before, He only played single player games. During that long year, He discovered Among Us, a game He always played with his daughters.

Each Realm in The RoyaLand wiil be a totally unique game map, open and with its own environmental characteristics. The goal is to design and develop game environments with immersive and detailed graphics, providing players with an engaging visual experience.

The initial eight Realms, corresponding to the eight royal families participating in the project, will be divided into different areas, all explorable by the user: players will be able to discover them both in single player and in certain multiplayer activities. Each Realm will visually blend with the predominant architectural style of the real country of origin of the respective royal family. For example, the realm under the control of the d’Orléans family will have a style that combines and fuses French Gothic with Art Nouveau.

The RoyaLand will allow users to engage with the game world with great freedom. In addition to different approaches to gameplay itself, in The RoyaLand players can choose to dedicate themselves to the main single-player campaign or focus on multiplayer activities, challenging other players in competitive or collaborative tasks, which will take place on dedicated game maps.

The RoyaLand will not merely be a game; it will serve as a gateway connecting the realm of video gaming with the rich histories and contemporary narratives of royal families worldwide. This endeavor aims to craft an engaging and immersive experience that transcends traditional gaming, inviting players into a world where history, culture, and interactive entertainment converge.The RoyaLand ecosystem will be a comprehensive platform that aims to enrich the user experience by integrating a game, a mobile app, and a website. This ecosystem will be designed to create a unique digital brand experience, fostering a community around The RoyaLand game.

The RoyaLand storyline will be an inquiry into the meaning of freedom, honor, and responsibility in a world where the choices of a few can determine the fate of many. The saga will invite players to reflect on the duality of change and conservation, individualism and collectivity, through the epic of a kingdom on the brink of a revolution that could either redeem or condemn it.
