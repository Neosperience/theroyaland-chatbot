Picture a world where technology harmoniously melds with nature, where cities are draped in green and powered by renewable energies, and where society is built on principles of equity and sustainability. This is the beating heart of solarpunk, an optimistic and revolutionary vision of the future. We decided to bring this optimistic vision of the future, enriched with characteristics of the fantasy world, into the world of The RoyaLand.

About The RoyaLand Company Ltd. The RoyaLand Company Ltd. is a Bermuda holding company founded by the Prince of Italy Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia and seven other royal families, and is focused on creating an immersive, AI-enabled, royalty-themed online role-playing gaming experience using digital humans. The Company’s business models are primarily centered around TheRoyal.Land, the first historically inspired, monarchy-themed, massively multiplayer online role-playing game, or MMORPG. The Company is developing these products in collaboration with its founder, the Monaco-based grandson of the last King of Italy, who holds the titles of His Royal Highness, Prince of Venice, Prince of Piedmont, and the hereditary “Prince of Italy.” RoyaLand also has the support and affiliation of seven other Royal Families in Russia, Albania, France, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Lesotho, and Mecklenburg. TheRoyal.Land is intended to deliver this unique past-meets-future entertainment experience. The Company is currently in the development phase and has entered into a project agreement with Neosperience S.p.A. who will design and develop TheRoyal.Land using AI-enabled technology. 


Neosperience plans to use AI models to create complex and dynamic in-game environments and realistic and emotive characters and to assist with dynamically adjusting the difficulty level and game balance in real-time based on player behavior and performance to keep the game challenging yet rewarding. For example, Neosperience’s AI-enabled technology can imbue non-player characters, or NPCs, with various behaviors, which we believe makes them seem more lifelike and responsive thereby enhancing player immersion and creating a more engaging gameplay experience. Additionally, Neosperience intends to use advanced modeling and rendering techniques to create realistic player characters and NPCs that dynamically interact utilizing a full range of human-like emotions, reactions, and movements (“digital humans”) giving them a depth of character which we believe is rarely seen in video games. 


The Company’s objective is to capitalize on the expanding video games market -- with worldwide revenue expected to grow to approximately $366B in 2023 according to Statista -- by connecting and engaging with players from around the world through epic royalty-themed entertainment and becoming a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and services as well as related media delivering engaging entertainment experiences to its network of connected players on a year-round basis.


The House of Savoy, also known as Casa Savoia, is a royal dynasty with its origins dating back to 1003 in the historical Savoy region, situated between modern-day France and Italy. Initially ruling a small Alpine county in north-west Italy, the House of Savoy gradually expanded its power and territory over the centuries. Their rule extended to the Kingdom of Sicily in the early 18th century, and they later gained control over Sardinia. In the 19th century, the House of Savoy played a pivotal role in the Italian unification movement, leading to the establishment of the Kingdom of Italy. Prominent Savoyard kings of Italy included Victor Emmanuel II, Umberto I, Victor Emmanuel III, and Umberto II. The House of Savoy's history is marked by territorial expansion, strategic alliances, and shifting loyalties, including a brief period of ruling the Kingdom of Spain in the 19th century.

Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, and Ahmet Zogu played a crucial role in the country's political landscape during this period. He was elected as Albania's Prime Minister in 1922. In 1928, Ahmet Zogu declared himself King Zog I of Albania, effectively establishing a monarchy in the country.

Leka Anwar Zog Reza Baudouin Msiziwe Zogu, Prince of Albania, was born on March 26, 1982, in Tirana, Albania. He was the only son of Leka, Prince of Albania, and his wife, Susan Cullen-Ward. Leka was born into the Albanian royal family during a time when the monarchy had been abolished, and Albania was a republic. Leka grew up in exile, primarily in South Africa and the United Kingdom, as his family continued their efforts to maintain their royal status and engage with Albanian exiles and supporters. In 2002, a significant event occurred in Leka's life and the history of the Albanian monarchy. A referendum was held in Albania to determine whether the country should restore the monarchy. Although the referendum did not result in a return to monarchy, it allowed Leka and his family to make a high-profile return to Albania, where they were met with both enthusiasm and controversy. Leka Anwar Zog Reza Baudouin Msiziwe Zogu, often referred to simply as Leka II, continued to be involved in Albanian public life and maintained connections with various political and social figures in the country. He inherited the role of head of the House of Zogu from his father, Leka, Prince of Albania, and carried on the family's commitment to the idea of a constitutional monarchy. Throughout his life, Leka II remained a symbol of the Albanian monarchy, even though it had not been officially reinstated. He married Elia Zaharia, and the couple had a son named Leka, born in 2011.

He is considered by some as a pretender to the defunct French throne, although France is a republic today.

The history of the Bulgarian royal family is marked by periods of monarchy and republicanism. It has its origins in the medieval Bulgarian Empire, which spanned from the 7th to the 14th century, and was ruled by notable monarchs such as Khan Asparuh, Khan Krum, and Tsar Simeon I. However, in 1396, Bulgaria fell under Ottoman Turkish rule, enduring nearly five centuries of foreign domination. During this extended period, Bulgaria lost its sovereignty, and its monarchy ceased to exist. It wasn't until 1908 that Bulgaria regained its independence and established a constitutional monarchy, with Ferdinand I as its first monarch. This marked a new era for the Bulgarian monarchy. After World War II, Bulgaria was declared a people's republic, and the monarchy was abolished in 1946. The royal family went into exile, and Bulgaria remained a communist state until the early 1990s. With the fall of communism, Bulgaria transitioned to a democratic republic. Some members of the former royal family, including Simeon II, returned to Bulgaria and became involved in politics. Simeon II even served as the country's Prime Minister from 2001 to 2005. While Bulgaria remains a republic, the history of its royal family reflects the nation's complex journey through monarchy, foreign rule, and republicanism.


The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is a European royal dynasty with its origins in the 19th century. It was formed when Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, married Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg in 1826, merging the two German duchies. Their descendants adopted the name Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. One of the most notable members of this dynasty was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who married Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in 1840. This marriage had a significant impact on European royal history, as their descendants became connected to numerous European royal families. King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, the son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, initiated the use of the family name Windsor during World War I due to anti-German sentiments. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha also produced Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, who became the first monarch of independent Bulgaria in 1908. In 1917, during World War I, King George V of the United Kingdom officially changed the house's name to the House of Windsor to distance the British monarchy from its Germanic associations. Despite this change, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha continues to play a role in the history and genealogy of European royalty.


The Karađorđević dynasty is a Serbian royal dynasty with a history dating back to the early 19th century. It was founded by Karađorđe Petrović, a Serbian revolutionary leader who played a crucial role in the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire. Under Karađorđe's leadership, the Serbs sought to gain autonomy and independence from Ottoman rule. The First Serbian Uprising began in 1804 and marked the beginning of the dynasty's prominence. Karađorđe Petrović was elected as the leader of the Serbian rebels, and they managed to establish a semi-autonomous Serbian state. However, the uprising was ultimately crushed by the Ottomans in 1813, leading to Karađorđe's exile. In 1815, Miloš Obrenović, a rival leader, assumed power in Serbia, and the Obrenović dynasty came to prominence. The Karađorđevićs remained in exile for several decades. The fortunes of the Karađorđević dynasty changed in the mid-19th century when Karađorđe's descendants returned to Serbia. In 1903, King Alexander I of Serbia, a member of the Karađorđević family, led a successful coup against the Obrenović monarchy. This event marked the restoration of the Karađorđević dynasty to the Serbian throne. Today, the Karađorđević dynasty maintains a presence in Serbia, and Crown Prince Alexander has worked on various philanthropic and cultural initiatives. While Serbia remains a republic, the Karađorđevićs continue to hold a symbolic and historical significance in the country's history.


Filip Karađorđević, also known as Prince Philip of Yugoslavia, was born on January 15, 1982, in Fairfax, Virginia, USA.

Prince Philip is the son of Crown Prince Alexander Karađorđević and his first wife, Princess Maria da Gloria of Orléans-Braganza. He is the grandson of King Peter II of Yugoslavia, who reigned during the early 20th century. Due to his family's royal lineage, Prince Philip holds the title of "Prince of Yugoslavia." He spent his early years in the United States and later moved to the United Kingdom. Prince Philip received his education at various international schools and universities, including Sandhurst, the Royal Military Academy. He pursued a military career and served in various regiments, including the Lifeguards and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. In addition to his military service, Prince Philip has been involved in various charitable and humanitarian activities. He is dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of Serbia and promoting Serbian culture abroad. He has also worked on initiatives related to education and youth development. Prince Philip's return to Serbia, along with other members of the Karađorđević family, coincided with the political changes in Yugoslavia during the 1990s and the eventual fall of communism. While Serbia is a republic, the Karađorđević family has played a symbolic and cultural role in the country. Prince Philip Karađorđević continues to be involved in philanthropic work and maintains ties with Serbia's cultural and historical heritage. His presence represents a link to Serbia's royal history and traditions, even in the modern era.

He hailed from the Bamokoteli lineage, a sub-clan of the Basotho people, and was the son of Mokhachane and Kholu. His original name was Lepoqo, which meant "Dispute," a name attributed to accusations of witchcraft around the time of his birth. In his youth, Moshoeshoe helped his father consolidate power over smaller clans, and at the age of 34, he established his own clan and became a chief. His followers settled at the Butha-Buthe Mountain. In 1822, Moshoeshoe became the first and longest-reigning King of Lesotho.. During the 1820s, the Basotho faced cattle raids by the Koranna, leading to their first encounters with horses and guns. Moshoeshoe and his people acquired horses and guns, amassing more than any other chieftain in South Africa by 1843. In 1843, Moshoeshoe signed a treaty with the British Cape Colony, recognizing the Basotho as allies. Over the years, he navigated negotiations and treaties while dealing with colonial pressures and territorial disputes. Moshoeshoe's legacy includes his role in establishing the nation of the Basotho, and he is celebrated annually on Moshoeshoe Day, a national holiday in Lesotho. The Moshoeshoe I International Airport bears his name, and South African shweshwe fabric is named after him, as he popularized it in his realm.

The House of Mecklenburg, a European dynasty, has its origins dating back to the 12th century in what is now known as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, northern Germany. This noble house emerged as a prominent force in the region through strategic marriages and alliances, eventually establishing two main duchies: Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. These duchies, initially part of the Holy Roman Empire, expanded their territories over the centuries. The House of Mecklenburg endured the challenges of the devastating Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, leading to economic hardships and destruction in the region. During this time, Mecklenburg-Schwerin came under Swedish control. However, after the war, it was returned to the House of Mecklenburg. In the 18th century, the dukes of Mecklenburg embraced Enlightenment ideals, leading to a period of reform and modernization in governance, education, and agriculture. This era marked significant progress for the region. The 19th century saw Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz as grand duchies within the newly formed German Empire in 1871. They retained some autonomy within the empire. Today, the House of Mecklenburg exists as a noble family with historical significance but without any ruling authority. Members of the house are involved in various charitable activities and cultural endeavors, contributing to the region's rich heritage. While no longer governing the region, the House of Mecklenburg remains an important part of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's history.

Solarpunk is a literary and artistic movement that envisions and works toward actualizing a sustainable future interconnected with nature and community. The "solar" represents solar energy as a renewable energy source and an optimistic vision of the future that rejects climate doomerism, while the "punk" refers to the countercultural, post-capitalist, and decolonial enthusiasm for creating such a future. As a science fiction literary subgenre and art movement, solarpunk works address how the future might look if humanity succeeded in solving major contemporary challenges with an emphasis on sustainability, human impact on the environment, and addressing climate change and pollution. Especially as a subgenre, it is aligned with cyberpunk derivatives, and may borrow elements from utopian and fantasy genres. Solarpunk serves as a foil to the cyberpunk genre, particularly within the fashion industry.  Both genres create and consolidate post-industrial countercultures; Solarpunk incites rebellion through its depiction of protoenvironmental socioecological relationships, whereas Cyberpunk advances the theme of rebellion through detached secondary environments, which often takes place in tangible dataspheres, virtual landscapes, and dystopian urban environments. Solarpunk draws inspiration from Bohemian style. The convergence of environmentalism and art serve as a framework for both subgenres. Solarpunk's interpretation of social collectivism strongly contrasts the individuality of Bohemian counterculture; Solarpunk recognizes individuality as an integral component of progressivism and identifies sociocultural distinctions as an impetus for change, though Solarpunk encompasses these elements within the greater socioecological scaffolding in a manner that contrasts the Bohemian assertion that individuality alone acts as the sole impetus for change.
